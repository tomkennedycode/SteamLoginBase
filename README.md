# SteamLoginBase
Simple script to get an understanding of how the Steam OpenID API works.

To setup, simply add your Steam API key in the steam_api.php file.
Then you are good to go.

If you have any problems, dont hesitate to contact me on Github.

## Note: This is using LightOpenID, a depricated PHP5 libary which was last updated in 2016. Use with caution.
